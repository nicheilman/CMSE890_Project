# Tutorial

## Getting Started
First thing that you need to do to implement this workflow is to download an up-to-date version of conda. From there you can read in the environment.yml file to build the conda environment that you will be using. \
Once the appropriate environment has been built and activated, the workflow can be run in the following two ways: \

1. Run each of the python scripts individually and pass the output from one to the next. 
```
python3 geom.py
python3 flow.py
python3 render.py
```
